This Python project is re-writing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm with recursion. The recursive algorithm will call itself 
The algorithm can be used to find the shortest path between a network of nodes and is therefore useful for planning networks. 
Users can input the values for their network nodes into the matrix within the Python script to get started using the project. 
This project is maintained and contributed to by Louise Charlesworth-Herbert
